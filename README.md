i wanted to add the start entrance door loading and opening animation
but the video is lagging a lot

# install

1. clone this repo to `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/`
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sglkc/kde-splash-genshin.git Genshin
   ```
2. directory name should be one word with uppercase first letter? if not it will break
3. you can change the video if you want, but large videos will be laggy
